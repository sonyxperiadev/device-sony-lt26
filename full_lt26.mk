# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for lt26 hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps).

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.

# This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
#$(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/full_base_telephony.mk)

# Discard inherited values and use our own instead.
